# SecureSwap DEX

---

## Project Description

SecureSwap DEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. It provides a secure, transparent, and permissionless platform for users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and earn trading fees. The platform implements an automated market maker (AMM) mechanism to facilitate token swaps without the need for traditional order books.

The smart contract includes comprehensive features such as liquidity management, token swapping with customizable fees, multi-token support, and administrative controls. SecureSwap DEX ensures security through rigorous validation checks and access control mechanisms.
